	<h1>Why Should I become a developer?</h1>
	<p>
		Web development is a fast-paced and challenging career,
		centered on creative problem-solving and continuous innovation.
        As a web developer you’ll work with a multidisciplinary team of 
		designers, other developers, and marketers to realize your projects.
		It’s no wonder, then, that it’s a much-praised area to get into to.
